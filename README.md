# Pathfinding Starter Code

Assignment 6 Dijkstra's:
    I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm in pathing.py using a heapq. My method for properly updating item priority is the continue statement if the node is already visited (extra credit 1). Additionally, I implemented A* with euclidean distance from the node to the target (either the target node or the end node, depending on which half of the path you're on) as the heuristic. (extra credit 2)

Assignment 7 Floyd-Warshall:
    I implemented Floyd-Warshall's algorithm to find the shortest path from start to end including the target node. For extra credit, I added a Floyd-Warshall player in place of the Dijkstra player.
